But while you're there you ask to get a multi-point inspection regardless, to see what additional maintenance requirements need to be done since the last time you had a previous tune-up. You will then be provided with an estimate as to what maintenance is required for your vehicle at the moment.";  //Message to display to user about the overview of this calculation.
